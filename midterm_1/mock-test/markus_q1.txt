 - For the mock test, you do not need to write full answers to get full marks, but you do need to make some changes to the file and submit it.


Q. A defragmentation program reorganizes the blocks on a disk to maximize the contiguous free space on the disk. You can think of the blocks on the disk as an array, where the block number is an index into the array. Consider the following two algorithms:
Alg. A: Free blocks are filled by used blocks from the end of the disk. 
Alg. B: Blocks are moved around until all the files in the block group are stored contiguously.

Part (a) 
Which of the two algorithms would complete faster on average? Explain your thinking.
----


----
Part (b) 
Which of the two algorithms would lead to better performance in terms of time to access blocks during normal operation? Assume we are using a magnetic disk. Explain clearly.
----

----
Part (c) [2 marks] 
Consider an inode based-file system like ext2.
What changes, if any, are made to the inodes? Explain your answer.
----


----
What changes, if any, would need to be made to the directory metadata by the defragmentation algorithm? Explain your answer.
----

----
Part (d) Consider a linked file system structure like FAT.
What changes, if any, are made to the FAT (File Allocation Table) by the defragmentation algorithm? Explain your answer.

What changes, if any, are made to the directory metadata by the defragmentation algorithm? Explain your answer.
